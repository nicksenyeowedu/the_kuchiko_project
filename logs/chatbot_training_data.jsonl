  "query": "Who were the Brooke’s",
  "answer": "Oh, the Brookes! They were the White Rajahs who ruled Sarawak for about a century. James Brooke was the first—he established his rule over Sarawak and really set the foundation. Then came Charles Brooke, the second Rajah, who continued building on what James started. They were both deeply connected to Kuching and played a huge role in shaping the region, especially in encouraging migration and development here.\n\nWant to explore more about their era and connections?\n• Kuching Old Bazaar\n• Chinese migrants  \n• Sarawak\n• Madam Harriette\n• Tua Pek Kong temple\n\nWhich one catches your interest?"
